# Department of Stochastic Simulation and Safety Research for Hydrosystems 

Welcome to the github page of the Department of Stochastic Simulation and Safety Research for Hydrosystems ([LS3](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/ls3/)). We are part of the Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems (IWS) of the Faculty for Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Cluster of Excellence SimTech of the University of Stuttgart.  Furthermore, we participate in the Collaborative Research Centers Interface-Driven Multi-Field Processes in Porous Media - Flow, Transport and Deformation and CAMPOS - Catchments as Reactors: Metabolism of Pollutants on the Landscape Scale.

We are a team of researchers with many different scientific backgrounds from all over the world. This diversity and our great team spirit are essential for excellent research and teaching.

We collaborate strongly with internationally renowned researchers. These collaborations comprise projects related to environmental modelling, underground contaminant transport, statistics, optimization, quantification of uncertainty, system reliability, system security and energy systems.
